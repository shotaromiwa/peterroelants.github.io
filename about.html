<p>
This blog started from some IPython notebooks with notes I made for myself. Starting from these notebook files it was only a small effort to publish them on Github Pages so that they might be of benefit to others. I hope you like the posts, comments are always welcome.
</p>

<p>This blog is made using <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/">Jekyll</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>. To publish the IPython notebook files I created a <a href="https://github.com/peterroelants/peterroelants.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/notebook_convert.py">small script</a> that uses <a href="https://nbconvert.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">nbconvert</a> to convert the notebooks into HTML.
